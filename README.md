# ESP32-Chime

How to program the ESP, see repository ESP32-Doorbell

The ESP32-chime is made, to send a 433mhz signal supported by rcswitch library or modify a byron 23513 chime to a wifi chime

Sending the command http://ip/ring will trigger the code in the esp32 chime.
This will output the code, which can be send using a 433mhz transmitter, or build in the byron 23513 chime
